# to-do-app
A checkpoint in the Bloc Design Program on DOM scripting.

# role/tasks
In this project I was given an index.html file and some .js files to create a simple to-do app. The assignment involved me adding code for the user to enter a new item to do, check that item off and then delete an item that was no longer needed.
